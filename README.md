Swedish software engineer interested in functional programming, type systems and FOSS. Most of my spare-time coding revolves around improving websites via userscripts. I'm also the creator of (as far as I know) [the only true clone](/SimonAlling/kurve) of the original _Achtung, die Kurve!_ game for the web browser.
